# Privacy Policy for CareJournal

**Last Updated: 2025-09-15**

Thank you for using CareJournal. Your privacy is our top priority. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage

**CareJournal does not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal health information. All data you enter is stored exclusively on your own device.**

The data you enter into the app, including your health logs, notes, and photos, is saved in a database on your phone that is protected with strong, industry-standard AES-256 encryption. This means your data is unreadable to anyone who does not have access to your device and your authentication credentials (passcode, fingerprint, or face ID).

## 2. Data Ownership

**You are the sole owner of your data. CareJournal provides tools for you to export or delete your data at any time.**

You can export your data to a CSV or PDF file to share with your healthcare provider or for your own records. You can also delete your data at any time by uninstalling the app.
