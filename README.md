# CareJournal

A privacy-first digital health journal for individuals managing chronic conditions. CareJournal is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to be a secure, private, and non-algorithmic tool for logging, managing, and understanding your health data.

## Guiding Philosophy

-   **Absolute Privacy:** All data is stored and processed exclusively on your device. Nothing is ever sent to a server.
-   **User Empowerment:** The app provides tools for self-discovery, not algorithmic prescriptions. It helps you see your own patterns.
-   **Practical Utility:** Features are designed to solve real-world pain points for individuals managing chronic health conditions.

## Features

-   **Unified Health Log:** A chronological timeline of all your health entries.
-   **Multiple Entry Types:** Log notes, symptoms, and photos.
-   **Symptom Tracking:** Record symptom severity on a scale of 1-10 and specify the location.
-   **Search and Filter:** Easily find past entries with a powerful search bar.
-   **Data Visualization:** A dashboard with charts to help you visualize your health data over time.
-   **Secure Backup and Restore:** Create encrypted, password-protected backups of your data that you can store in your personal cloud storage.
-   **Data Export:** Export your data to PDF or CSV for sharing with your healthcare providers.
-   **Light/Dark Mode:** The app respects your system's theme settings.
-   **Privacy by Design:** No cloud sync, no data collection, no tracking. Your data is yours.
